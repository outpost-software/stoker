## Google Cloud Projects

Your Stoker apps run on Google Cloud projects, which are also Firebase projects.

There is currently a limit of 100 Google Cloud projects per account, but you can [request a limit increase](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#managing_project_quotas_2).

## Firestore Indexes

Your project is subject to [limits on Firestore indexes](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quotas#indexes). If you exceed these limits, you can request an increase.
