## Error Reporting

You can view error logs for your back end services in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/errors). We recommend setting up notifications for each production project.

## Firebase Performance

Your Stoker project is set up to track web performance metrics via [Firebase Performance](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon). Metrics can be viewed in the Firebase Console.

## Monitor Firestore Usage

You can monitor your Firestore usage in the [Google Cloud Console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/monitor-usage).

## Firestore Query Insights

You can [analyze your Firestore queries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/firestore/native/docs/query-insights) to see which ones are costing you the most.

## Firestore Key Visualizer

You can view performance metrics for your Firestore databases using the [Firestore Key Visualiser](https://docs.cloud.google.com/firestore/native/docs/key-visualizer).

## Firestore Traces

If you use [custom Cloud Functions](/docs/api-reference/Other%20Project%20Files#custom-cloud-functions) in your Stoker project, you can monitor the performance of your client-side Firestore queries using [Traces](https://docs.cloud.google.com/firestore/native/docs/client-side-traces).

## Database Center

Cloud Firestore metrics can be viewed alongside other Google Cloud databases as part of [Google Cloud Database Center](https://docs.cloud.google.com/database-center/docs/overview).
